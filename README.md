### Requirements

- Mac OS X 10.8 or later


### Development
DropCloud uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to handle it's dependencies and the [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. The master branch is always stable and the develop branch is the version, which is currently in development.
To build DropCloud, you have to install all dependencies first (`pod install`).
Make sure to open the `DropCloud.xcworkspace`, instead of the `.xcodeproj`.
